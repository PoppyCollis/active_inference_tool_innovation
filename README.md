# METATOOL_UoS

This codebase provides a minimal model of tool innovation that involves an active inference agent making generalised inferences about the tool structure required to solve an extension‐of‐reach task. For a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies and theories associated with this codebase, please refer to our research paper [Collis et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03893). The paper provides in‐depth insights and discussions on the concepts, experiments, and findings that form the basis of this project. We encourage readers and users of this repository to consult the paper for a more detailed exposition of the work presented here.

For details on the parameters and an explanation of the model, please see accompanying article: [D1_2_simple_metacognitive_model](https://github.com/PoppyCollis/METATOOL_UoS/blob/master/D1_2_Simple_Metacognitive_Model.pdf)
